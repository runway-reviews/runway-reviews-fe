## 💭 Abstract
This project allows a user to log into their account and view the reviews they made for a particular airport. They can also add a review of the airport based on a list of categories from a dropdown menu. They can then view the review that was just made. This project uses several different API's to get a list of airports, for the user to login and to show the reviews.


## 📝  Context
We are a group of 2 front-end developers and 3 back-end developers who worked together remotely via Zoom and asynchronously through the GitHub project board to complete this application. This project was completed from week 1 to week 3 in Mod 4 at Turing School of Software & Design. It was our first time using the Vue framework
